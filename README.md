# Summer2021_course
A course project done for HSE university 2 lections-course about webscrapping.
More precicely, there are 2 main parts of the program: webscrapping using BeautifulSoup from the free site, where Alice in Wonderland book is held, and auto-translation API from google translation done in the second program.
In future, program could be easily expanded to translate other books from the site http://www.literatureproject.com/index.htm pretty easily(we just need to change a little URL and job is done).
